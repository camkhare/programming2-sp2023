   	<li>The objective of blackjack is to get a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand value without going over 21. </li>
	<li> Players are dealt two cards, and the dealer is dealt one card face up and one card face down.</li>
	<li>Players can choose to "hit" (get another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand) until they are satisfied with their hand value or go over 21 (bust). </li>
	<li>The dealer must hit until their hand value is 17 or higher, and then must stand. </li>
	<li>If the player's hand value is higher than the dealer's and does not exceed 21, the player wins. If the dealer's hand value is higher than the player's, the player loses. </li>
	<li>Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10 points, and numbered cards are worth their face value. </li>
	<li>If the player's initial two cards are an ace and a 10-point card, they have a blackjack and automatically win 1.5 times their original bet.</li>
