	<h1>This is my website</h1>
	<p id = "text">Websites are digital platforms that allow individuals and businesses to share information, products, and services with a global audience. They are built using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can be accessed using a web browser. Websites vary in complexity, design, and purpose, ranging from simple personal blogs to complex e-commerce sites. They have revolutionized the way people communicate, learn, and conduct business, enabling anyone with an internet connection to access information and connect with others around the world. With the proliferation of mobile devices and increasing internet penetration, websites have become even more critical for businesses to reach their target audience and promote their products and services. </p>
