			Second hand smoke, also known as passive smoke or environmental tobacco smoke,<b> is a serious problem that affects people's health and well-being.</b> Not only does it contain harmful chemicals that can cause serious health problems, but it also emits a strong and unpleasant odor that can be difficult to get rid of. In this essay, I will argue that second hand smoke is not only a health hazard, but it also smells bad, making it a persuasive reason to avoid smoking in public spaces.

			<p style="font-size: 12;background-color: #3e5c1c; color: #8cc24f">
			First of all, second hand smoke contains over<i> 7,000 toxic chemicals</i>, many of which are known to cause cancer and other serious health problems. This means that not only are smokers putting their own health at risk, but they are also exposing those around them to these dangerous chemicals. The unpleasant odor of second hand smoke is a direct result of the toxic chemicals that are being released into the air, and is a clear indicator of the danger that passive smoke poses to those who are exposed to it.

			In addition to being a health hazard, second hand smoke also has a strong and unpleasant odor that can be difficult to get rid of. This odor can linger in clothing, hair, and even furniture, making it difficult to avoid even when you are not actively being exposed to smoke. This can be especially problematic in public spaces, where large numbers of people are often exposed to the smoke, and the odor can be particularly overpowering.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 12; background-color: #3e5c1c; color: #8cc24f">
			Another reason why second hand smoke smells bad is that it is often associated with negative experiences or memories. For example, many people associate the smell of smoke with the unpleasant experience of being trapped in a smoky room or being near someone who is smoking. This association can make the odor even more unpleasant, and can make it difficult to enjoy being in a public space where smoking is allowed.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 12; background-color: #3e5c1c; color: #8cc24f">
			In conclusion, second hand smoke is a serious problem that affects not only people's health but also their sense of well-being. The strong and unpleasant odor of second hand smoke is a clear indicator of the danger that passive smoke poses, and is a persuasive reason to avoid smoking in public spaces. By taking steps to reduce exposure to second hand smoke, we can help to create healthier and more enjoyable public spaces for everyone.
