	<h2> Why Grilled Cheese is So Good </h2>
	<p> Grilled cheese sandwiches are considered a comfort food for many people because they evoke feelings of nostalgia and bring back memories of childhood. The melted cheese and soft bread create a warm, gooey, and satisfying texture that is comforting to eat. Additionally, the simplicity of the dish means that it can be easily customized with different types of cheese and bread, allowing people to create their own unique version of this classic dish.

	Another reason grilled cheese is considered a great food is because of its delicious taste. The combination of melted cheese and toasted bread creates a harmonious blend of salty, savory, and slightly nutty flavors that is hard to resist. The golden brown exterior of the bread adds a crunchy texture that contrasts nicely with the soft, melted cheese inside. The dish can be served as a standalone meal or paired with soup or salad for a more complete dining experience. Overall, the irresistible taste, comforting texture, and nostalgic memories make grilled cheese a beloved food that will always be a staple in many people's hearts and stomachs. </p>
	<h3> Ingredients </h3>
	<ul>
		<li> <b>Bread </b>– a thicker sliced bread such as texas toast works best </li>
		<li> <b>Butter </b> – use a generous 1/2 Tbsp of butter on each slice of bread. We use unsalted but any butter will work here. </li>
		<li><b>Cheese </b> – we use a combination of sliced medium cheddar, gouda and Havarti cheese. </li>
	</ul>
	<h3> How to Make Grilled Cheese </h3>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Butter the toast</b> – spread 1/2 Tbsp butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
		<li><b>Heat skillet</b> – place a skillet over low to medium/low heat. A griddle should be at 275˚F. Immediately add 2 slices of bread with the butter-side-down.</li>
		<li><b>Add cheese </b>– stack cheeses on one of the pieces of bread, cover with the other piece of toast and flip the sandwich over.</li>
		<li><b>Brown the toast</b> – Continue sauteeing, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese is melted.</li>
		<li><b>Serve </b>– cut the sandwich in half on the diagonal to serve.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3> Tips for the Best Grilled Cheese</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Low heat </b> – it takes a little patience to make the perfect grilled cheese. Keep your heat on low to give the cheese time to fully melt while the bread gets golden and crisp. If browning too fast, turn the heat down.</li>
		<li><b>Butter generously </b> – the amount of butter may seem like a lot, but it is important for a crispy exterior. </li>
		<li><b>Use thick-sliced bread </b>– we love using Texas toast because it’s sliced about twice as thick as normal sandwich bread. You want bread that is about 3/4″ to 1″ thick, but also avoid bread that is too thick or your cheese won’t melt properly. Using bread that is too thin will produce a flimsy and sometimes soggy sandwich.</li>
	</ul>
